    Compute document vector as a (weighted) sum of individual word vectors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Pretrained word2vec model to convert words into vectors.
    document
        Document containing document.words and document.weights.
    intensity_weighting_power
        Specify to what power weights should be raised. The default is 0, which
        means that no weighing will be done.
    allowed_missing_percentage:
        Set the maximum allowed percentage of the document that may be missing
        from the input model. This is measured as percentage of the weighted, missing
        words compared to all word vectors of the document. Default is 0, which

    -------

        Vector representing the input document in latent space. Will return None
